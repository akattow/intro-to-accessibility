# I broke my neck

<FlexSplit>
<img src={brace} style={{marginLeft: 0, marginRight: '1em'}} alt="a photo of me in a neck brace"/>

<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>I couldn't bend my head down</li>
  <li>I couldn't lift my right arm up</li>
  <li>It really sucked</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

</FlexSplit>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- I was really lucky
- Only in the neck brace for 4 weeks
- I had full range of motion in my shoulder in about 3 or 4 months, although it took much longer to get my strength back

<Notes>

- You could be in a crash, like me
- You could have a surgical procedure or a common health condition
- This isn't just visbile, physical disabilities. This can include people with dyslexia, color blindness, learning disabilities, and a lot more.
- I guarantee your audience includes people with disabilities

# Stats <span role="img" aria-label="bar chart">ðŸ“Š</span>

In 2014, 85.3 million Americans were living with disabilities

<Appear>
  <p>That is over 1 in 4 people</p>
  <p>About 17.6 percent of people total, or 55.2 million, had a severe disability</p>

# The Top Million

<Appear>
  <p>In February 2019, WebAIM analyzed the top 1 million websites</p>
  <p>97.8% of those homepages had detectable accessibility issues</p>
  <p>There was an average of nearly 60 errors on each home page sampled</p>
</Appear>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- WebAIM only used automated analysis, which isn't capable of capturing all types of accessibility issues.
- What percentage do you think had some kind of accessibility issue?

# It's Money <span role="img" aria-label="money bag">ðŸ’°</span>

2008: Target paid 6 million + legal fees

2019: Domino's $?,???,??? (instead of $38,000)

</Layout>

<Notes>

- In 2008, Target paid 6 million, plus the cost of legal fees, to settle a class action lawsuit because their products were not accessible to blind users
- This year, Domino's decided that rather than spending $38,000 to update their website accessibility, they would pay legal fees to appeal to the Supreme Court

# How did it get so bad?

<img src={soBad} alt="a confused looking pug"/>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- A lot of accessibility is baked in to the web, but a lot of common practices break that built-in accessibility.
- The best way to build accessibile websites is just to know what to look for, which means debugging, manually testing your site, and user testing with users who rely on assistive technology

# What can you do?

Use your keyboard to tab through pages

Use [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) or  [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/)

Use [NVDA](https://webaim.org/articles/nvda/) and/or [Voiceover](https://webaim.org/articles/voiceover/)

Use browser zoom - all the way in!

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Use a keyboard and tab through - this should take you to every *interactive* element - buttons, links, inputs. You should also be able to see which element you're focused on
- Use a web extension like axe or accessibility insights to find low-hanging fruit
- Manually test your site with a screen reader. (use a cheatsheet!)
- Zoom all the way in - check for page scrolling, font size and scaling, and understandability

# "I can't see this"

<img src={stackOverflow} alt="a screenshot of low-contrast text from Stack Overflow"/>
<Appear>
<img src={sOaxe} alt="axe results from Stack Overflow - 102 color contrast issues" />
</Appear>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Going back to the WebAIM million study, about 85% of websites have insufficient color contrast
- pages had an average of 36 distinct instances
- common offenders: light gray text, white text on color
- White you're at it, make sure your font sizes are readable. No one is going to get their reading glasses to see your 8pt font.
- Do you have content like articles or blog posts? Make sure your pages can be printed! Look into print styles in CSS

# "No, I *really* can't see this"

<FlexCenter>
  
<a href="https://www.kattow.com" style={{marginRight: '1em', width: 'fit-content', background: 'none'}}><img src={coolPug} alt="link to kattow.com"/></a>

- *alt="a cool pug in sunglasses"*
- *alt=""*
- *alt="link to kattow.com"*

</FlexCenter>


</Layout>

<Notes>

- If you use a screen reader, it can read text. It can't read an image unless the developer tells it what's in the image
- if an image is purely decorative, you still need to add an empty alt tag
- the empty alt tag tells the screen reader to not bother announcing the image - if you don't include the alt tag at all, the image gets announced but it's contents are unexplained.
- if the image is a link, describe where the image will take the user

# "I am very confused"

<Appear>
  <p>Keep it simple, stupid</p>
  <p>Throw out that div soup</p>
  <p>The browser is smarter than you</p>
</Appear>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Your design should be easy to follow and understand. Users on the autism spectrum, low vision users who use screen magnification, users with dyslexia are all impacted
- Using semantic markup helps screen readers navigate through a page. Screen readers can skim through headings the same way sighted users might.
- Using semantic markup actually improves SEO as well.
- Navite UI controls (button, select, checkboxes) are much more accessible and easier to use than custom JS hacks. You can style them with CSS!

# "I am very, VERY confused"

Menus, modals... where am I?

[bonappetite](https://www.bonappetit.com/)

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Tab through a website.
- bonappetite: cannot tab while it loads, can't seem to tab to the menu button... oh, that's because it's a div, not a button
- You should be able to see where you are, open menus, and navigate.
- Don't remove focus styles!
- Test with a keyboard!

# "Just tell me what to do!"

**DO:** `<label>`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`

**DON'T:** 'Click here'

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Let's hop back to the WebAIM Million - 59% of the 3.4 million form input elements identified were unlabelled (either by label, aria-label, or aria-labelledby)
- Typically forms and input elements are the beginning of a marketing funnel - if users can't complete these because they don't know what is required, you're losing leads.

# "Make it stop!"

<FlexColumn>
<Gif gifImg={pugGif} staticImg={thanks} alt="a confused looking pug"/>
</FlexColumn>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Media and motion can make people sick. Bright flashing, fast or unexpected movement, animated infographics, and even parallax effects can cause a variety of ills.
- No one is saying we can't have motion and media on the web - a lot of it is beautiful, or helps convey complicated information.
- We need to ensure users have CONTROL
- Always include controls for media like video and audio
- Include closed captioning and transcripts
- Allow users to opt-in to motion: include a 'skip animation' button or offer a toggle at the top of the page, 
- use the `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS query!
